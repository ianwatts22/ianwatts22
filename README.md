Hi, I'm Ian Ellington Watts (born 3/7/98). I currently live in Los Angeles and building [Memory Labs](https://memorylabs.app/) and AI consulting/mentoring/tutoring. I studied mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan (2020) . I have a wide range of interests: technology (consumer software + hardware w/ a focus on self-improvement), health (fitness, nutrition, longevity, neuroscience), history (ancient Near East, Rome, Dan Carlin's most recent episode), art (video, music production).
