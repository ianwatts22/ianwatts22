Hi, I am Ian Ellington Watts earth/USA/CA/Los Angeles. I am 23 years old currently living in Los Angeles. I am a mechanical engineer by training (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 2020) and try to apply mechanistic thinking to all problems I tackle. I am deeply interested in technology (across the board), neuroscience, 

I am obsessed with self-improvement: the never-ending quest to become a better version of yourself. I don't know what that means, but I have some ideas that I pursue with excitement and vigor. I think self-improvement is the most powerful tool humans, and evolution, has to offer. 

My focus is on creating tools that provide people with increased agency: to help people help themselves. I believe the most effective way to do this currently is by harnessing the power of personal data (you make what you measure) to give poeple a holistic view of the lives and help them see, and change the future. 
This project is called the "Life Project". I am currently on Life Project 2. It can be found here: https://coda.io/@ian-watts/life-project-2

Coda is not a long-term viable strategy for this project so I am currently looking to move it to a website and setup a proper backend. Right now I am using   Integromat for backend data management and recently signed up for a Google Cloud trial and am exploring BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage. I am building my personal website on Webflow, but their CMS options (specifically their limitations on references) are very limiting for a data-driven project. The data structures and interfaces are constantly evolving as well, so I want to set up an adaptable system that allows for quick changes without much debt.
