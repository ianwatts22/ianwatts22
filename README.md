Hi, I'm Ian Ellington Watts (born 3/7/98). I currently live in Los Angeles and am working on building [Recreation](https://recreation.community/) and doing web development work (specifically in three.js). I did mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan (2020) and apply mechanistic thinking to all problems I tackle. I have a wide range of interests: technology (primarily consumer hardware + software focused on self-improvement), health (fitness, nutrition, longevity, neuroscience), art (video, music production).

I am obsessed with self-improvement: the never-ending quest to become a better version of yourself. I don't know what that means, but I have some ideas that I pursue with excitement and vigor. I think self-improvement is the most powerful tool humans, and evolution, has to offer.
